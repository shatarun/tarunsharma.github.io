**Design and Analysis of Tensile Specimen for Quasi Static Tests through FEM**  
*Project Supervisor: Mr. Pundan Kumar Singh, Principal Researcher*
*[Report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_ZcddhALcbVKgBeGIGA0JH4m8gN6X7v8/view?usp=sharing)*
*	Focused on the plastic region of deformation for high strain rates & modelled a tensile specimen using Abaqus 
*	The tensile test results contributed in designing new specimen for specific tests for automotive applications
