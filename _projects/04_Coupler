*Supersvisor: Prof. Nalinaksh S. Vyas*
* Worked as a Student Research Associate in Vibration Lab, IIT Kanpur	
*	Provided Frontier Technologies Pvt. Ltd. with the Finite Element Models of Railway Couplers used in LHB Bogies in India.
* Used ANSYS to verify the CAD model of the coupler assembly and performed FEA for various loading conditions like Buff, Draft & Bending to check the Equivalent Von-Mises Stress distribution, total deformation and Directional deformation of the coupler.
*	Simulated the Anti Climbing Feature of the coupler assembly in ANSYS under 45 tonnes of force.
