Supervised Learning using Deep Neural Networks 
=====
*Coursera Course: Neural Networks and Deep Learning*  *[Certification](https://www.exampleurl.com)*  
*Offered by: deeplearning.ai in their Deep Learning Specialization* 
* Implemented a single hidden layer shallow neural network for binary classification of different types of data sets
*	Trained the model for a dataset comprising of dots in the shape of a flower to get an accuracy of 91.25%
*	Implemented a deep neural network for binary classification of Cat vs Non-Cat images with an accuracy of 80%
* Implemented ‘He initialisation’ on a 3 layered DNN for binary classification of red and blue dots with an accuracy of 99%

Art Generation with Neural Style Transfer
=====
*Coursera Course: Convolutional Neural Networks*  *[Certification](https://www.exampleurl.com)*  
*Offered by: deeplearning.ai in their Deep Learning Specialization* 
*	Used Neural Style Transfer on top of a pretrained VGG-19 network
*	Merged style cost from multiple hidden layers and tuned the weights to get a final style cost function
*	Defined total cost as a linear combination of content cost and style cost
*	Used Adam optimizer to optimize the cost function to get the pixel values of the generated image
*	The generated image combined the content of an image with the style of a painting
*	Mixed image of the Louvre museum in Paris (content image C), with a painting by Claude Monet, a leader of the impressionist movement (style image S)

Face Recognition and Face Verification
=====
*Coursera Course: Convolutional Neural Networks*  *[Certification](https://www.exampleurl.com)*  
*Offered by: deeplearning.ai in their Deep Learning Specialization* 
*	Used Keras to build a facial verification model for identifying whether the employee is having the correct ID Card and is indeed an employee
*	Built upon a pretrained FaceNet model
*	Implemented a triplet loss function to distinguish between positive and negative from the anchor
*	Built a facial recognition model which eliminated the need of ID Card for the employees
*	The facial recognition model ran for all the images in the database and reported the database encoding which had the least L2 distance from the image encoding
*	The facial verification was a 1:1 problem whereas the facial recognition was a harder 1:K problem
