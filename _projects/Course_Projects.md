Motion Planning of a 6 DOF Robot Arm Manipulator 
=====
*Course: Robot Motion Planning*  
*Project Supervisor: Prof. Ashish Dutta*  
*	Used MATLAB to find the C-Space of a 3DOF & 2DOF Robot arm with obstacles.
*	Used sampling-based planners (A* Algorithm) for the path planning of a mobile robot in presence of obstacles.
*	Used Rapidly Exploring Random trees for path planning of a mobile robot.

Algorithm Study of Constrained and Unconstrained Optimization techniques
======
*Course: Optimization Methods*  
*Project Supervisor: Prof. Bhaskar Dasgupta*  
  * Analysed the performance of unconstrained optimization methods like Steepest Descent, DFP, BFGS and Powell’s Conjugate Direction.  
  * Studied the effect of different parameters like initial point, modality and concluded the global convergence on 50 different test functions.  
  * Linear and Quadratic Programming with Simplex, Active Set method and Lemke’s set method for multiple constraints was studied

Output feedback stabilisation of inverted pendulum
=====
*Course: Basics of Modern Control*  
*Project Supervisor: Prof. Ramprasad Potluri*  
 * Implemented the research paper, 'Output feedback stabilization of inverted pendulum on a cart in the presence of uncertainties'
 * Investigated the singularly perturbed form of the closed loop system including Extended High Gain Observers.
 * Used MATLAB and Visio to simulate and solve the steady state feedback equations and for Block Diagram visualization.

Helicopter Coupled Trim Analysis using MATLAB for a UH-60A Black Hawk helicopter
=====
*Course: Helicopter Dynamics & Aeroelasticity*  
*Project Supervisor: Prof. Abhishek*  
* Programmed a numerical solution to the combined blade-element/momentum theory (BEMT)
*	Used Newmark’s algorithm to solve the flap response equation numerically in a coupled trim solution.
*	Calculated all the blade hub shear forces and moments in the rotating frame of reference as a function of azimuth for a uniform inflow.
*	Performed the free flight coupled trim analysis for the same helicopter and found the variation of control angles, vehicle shaft angles and non-dimensional mean hub loads vs forward speed

Document Shredder & Automated Box Shifting Mechanism
=====
*Courses: TA201A & TA202A* 	
*Project Supervisors: Prof. S.K. Choudhary, Prof. Rajiv Shekhar*
* Deployed SolidWorks 2016 and AutoCAD 2015 for modelling the mechanisms.
*	Designed and fabricated the working prototypes using CNC machine, Lathe machine and Drilling machine.
*	Made a Costing Report, Business Plan and Marketing Brochure for the developed prototypes of the mechanisms.
