1. **Algorithm Study of Constrained and Unconstrained Optimization techniques**  
   *March 2019 - April 2019*  
   *Course: Optimization Methods*  
   *Project Supervisor: Prof. Bhaskar Dasgupta*  
    -	Analysed the performance of unconstrained optimization methods like Steepest Descent, DFP, BFGS and Powell’s Conjugate Direction.
    - Studied the effect of different parameters like initial point, modality and concluded the global convergence on 50 different test functions.
    -	Linear and Quadratic Programming with Simplex, Active Set method and Lemke’s set method for multiple constraints was studied

2. **Output feedback stabilisation of inverted pendulum **  
   * **Landing of a VTOL UAV on a Vertically Oscillating Platform**
      * Implemented the research paper, 'Output feedback stabilization of inverted pendulum on a cart in the presence of uncertainties'
      * Investigated the singularly perturbed form of the closed loop system including Extended High Gain Observers.
      * Used MATLAB and Visio to simulate and solve the steady state feedback equations and for Block Diagram visualization.

3. Rail Road Vehicle Dynamics
   * **Rail Vehicle Stability**
     * Lateral Dynamics - With given track – wheel geometry, contact patch co-ordinates were determined as a function of lateral perturbation by solving the kinematic equations. With geometry as input, equations of motion were solved iteratively on Matlab to get forces at each time step and further estimate critical speed of stability
     * Longitudinal Dynamics – Observed the response characteristics of the model of a railway coupler by varying source frequency, spring stiffness, draft gear friction and coupler slack
     * Software Modeling – Developed a model of rail-wheel pair in Simpack, and observed the motion in a straight track, by varying the wheel positions
4. Basics of Modern control
   * **Nonlinear Feedback Control for Autonomous Vehicles**
     * Implemented the research paper, 'Composite Nonlinear Feedback Control for Path Following of Four-Wheel Independently Actuated Autonomous Ground Vehicles'(AGVs')
     * Investigated  the path-following control problem for AGVs through integrated control of active front-wheel steering and direct yaw-moment control
     * Applied modified composite non-linear feedback strategy to improve the transient performance and eliminate the steady-state errors in path-following control
5. Vibration of Continuous Systems
   * **Nonlinear Control of Flexible Manipulators**
     * Designed a strain feedback nonlinear control for joint-PD controlled single-link flexible manipulator to improve tip regulation performance
     * Solved the modal problem for a beam with tip mass and base moment for first four modes
     * Simulated the PD controller and nonlinear strain feedback controller for various gains in MATLAB
6. Virtual Instrumentation
   * **Modal Testing and Analysis Software**
     * Developed a GUI-based software for Modal Testing and Analysis using LabVIEW
     * Performed frequency analysis and system identification using DAQ and Signal Processing tools
