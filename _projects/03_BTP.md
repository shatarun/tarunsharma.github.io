*	Developed the 1st generation of a highly compact & cheap Moving Iron Type Actuator to provide a force output of 100N to be used as active damping devices
*	Developed a cheap Moving Iron Type Linear Electromagnetic Actuator to be used as active damping devices
*	The actuator works by passing electricity through stator coils which create an attractive electromagnetic force. Placing two sets of such coils on either sides of the moving iron and then switching currents at a given frequency creates an oscillatory motion. This moving iron is connected to linear flexural bearings, which help in transmitting force to the body of the actuator.
*	The actuator generated a peak force of about 13 N in a frequency range of 30 â€“ 140 Hz. With slight modification in design, a peak force of 100N can be generated theoretically
*	Isolated the natural frequency and obtained a flat frequency response in 30-140 Hz
