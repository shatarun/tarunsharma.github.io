I am a Research Assistant working under [Prof. Nalinaksh S. Vyas](http://home.iitk.ac.in/~vyas/) at Mission Lab, Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur. I have recently completed my B.Tech-M.Tech Dual Degree in Mechanical Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur. My research interests right now cover a multitude of fields some of which are Multibody Dynamics, Machine Tool Dynamics, Vibration and Control, Robotics, Neural Networks, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence and Finite Element Modelling. I like working on mathematical and physical modelling, enjoy solving analytical problems, working on simulations and love to automate various procedures. Problems which lie at a junction of multiple fields intrigue me and I like to enjoy the mathematics and physics behind them.

I have recently completed my work on Primary Suspension Redesign of Railway Bogie for Improved Fatigue Life for my master's thesis under the guidance of [Prof. Nalinaksh S. Vyas](http://home.iitk.ac.in/~vyas/) and [Prof. C. Chandraprakash](https://chandraprakashster.wixsite.com/chan). The design improvements suggested in the thesis have been accepted by Indian Railways and will roll out in production soon for all the FIAT type bogies used in LHB Coaches of India. I'm currently working as a Senior Research Associate in Mission Lab, IIT Kanpur under [Prof. Nalinaksh S. Vyas](http://home.iitk.ac.in/~vyas/).

Apart from academics, I enjoy cooking and learning various recipes, love eating (Cheeseburst pizza, Vanilla Icecream and Litti-chokha tops my list) and like travelling and exploring the countryside. I'm also an adventure enthusiast and an adrenaline junkie. I like indulging in various sports like cricket, football, basketball, swimming from time to time and would like to learn tennis, archery and shooting in the near future. I have made multiple unsuccessful attempts at reading novels and would like to complete reading the books sitting idle on my shelf one day.

"Courage is willingness to take the risk once you know the odds. Optimistic overconfidence means you are taking the risk because you don't know the odds. It's a big difference." â€• Daniel Kahneman
